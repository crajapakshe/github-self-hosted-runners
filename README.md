GitHub self-hosted runners are custom compute resources that you can set up in your own data centers or cloud infrastructure to run GitHub Actions jobs. Self-hosted runners give you more control over the computing resources that run your GitHub Actions workflows.

Some key features of GitHub self-hosted runners:

- **Customization**: You can customize the hardware, operating system, tools, and dependencies of your self-hosted runners to match your specific needs.
- **Security**: Self-hosted runners run in your own secure environment, allowing you to meet any security or compliance requirements.
- **Cost Control**: Running jobs on your own infrastructure can provide cost savings compared to using GitHub-hosted runners.
- **Faster Execution**: Jobs running on self-hosted runners don't need to be queued and can start immediately, which can speed up your workflows.

To get started with self-hosted runners, you'll need to download the runner application and configure it to work with your GitHub repository. Detailed instructions can be found in the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).
